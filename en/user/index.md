# Ctrl-Space User Documentation #

## Target Group ##

These topics should be read if you plan to use Blueprints (e.g. Standard Blueprint Library or some other Blueprint library).
If you plan to write Blueprints on your own, the [Developer Documentation](/en/developer/index.md) may be interesting for you, too.

## Content ##

These pages will guide you through the steps of Ctrl-Space installation and give you a small tutorial on how to use the
core features. They show you how to use Blueprints from the Standard Blueprint Library (SBL) and the ImageViewer.
